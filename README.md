# 8-bit-Current-Steering-DAC-using-180nm-technology

We designed an 8-bit current-steering DAC using 180nm technology in Cadence Virtuoso. An 8-bit up-down counter provides inputs to the DAC through transmission gates that switch based on these inputs. A PMOS current mirror sinks current in a binary-weighted fashion, with a current reference generated by a V-I converter from a band-gap reference. Finally, all currents are summed and filtered by a buffer with a low-pass filter to produce the analog output signal (sine wave).
